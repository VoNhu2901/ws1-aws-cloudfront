**AWS CloudFront** is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's designed to accelerate the delivery of web content — such as images, videos, and static files — to users by caching the content at edge locations around the world. This reduces latency and improves the overall user experience.

By using CloudFront, you get the following advantages that traditional methods do not have:

- **Faster content delivery.** CloudFront caches content at edge locations, reducing the time it takes for users to access your content.
- Global coverage. With a vast network of edge locations, CloudFront can deliver content to users worldwide with low latency. 
- **Scalability.** CloudFront automatically scales to handle traffic spikes, ensuring consistent performance. 
- **Security.** CloudFront integrates with AWS security services, such as AWS Shield and AWS WAF, to protect your content from DDoS attacks and other threats. 
- **Cost-effective.** CloudFront offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing you to pay only for the data transfer and requests you use.
